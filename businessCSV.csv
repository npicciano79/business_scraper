Their success was the first chapter in an over 200 year tradition of representing the needs of the New Haven business community.Today, our mission is to provide leadership in marshalling the physical, economic, and human resources of the south central Connecticut region – comprising the municipalities of Bethany, Branford, Cheshire, East Haven, Guilford, Hamden, Madison, Milford, New Haven, North Branford, North Haven, Orange, Wallingford, West Haven, and Woodbridge – for its effective development as a favorable place to operate a business, a desirable place to work, and an attractive place to live.
